<before>
This project will have me create a basic recipe website.

1. The website will have a main index page.
2. The main index page will have links to a few recipes.

By doing this project I will have demonstrated my abilities to:
    ~Understand and write HTML boilerplate effectively
    ~Use Git and GitHub effectively to save my project
    ~Work efficiently within the command line
    ~Work with using links, both absolute and relative
    ~Work with using images, both absolute and relative
