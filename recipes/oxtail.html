        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is one of my favorite meals to make on special occasions. This dish shows people who aren't familiar with Jamiacan quisine just how delicious and complex it can be(and from cheap ingredients too!).</p>
        <p>Usually oxtail is a labour of love and takes time to make properly but with the use of a pressure cooker that won't be necessary. The prep time should be 30 minutes with a cook time of roughly 45 minutes. This recipe will serve 4 people.</p>
